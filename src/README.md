## 1. Introduction

---

This "mini-portal" is a demonstration of several of the packages used in the [MyESnet Portal](https://my.es.net/).  In particular it shows an example of using:

   * [react-timeseries-charts](http://software.es.net/react-timeseries-charts)
   * [react-network-diagrams](http://software.es.net/react-network-diagrams)
   * [pond](http://software.es.net/pond)


This was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which is a great way to bootstrap a React project.

### Running the code locally

Here's the steps to run the code so you can experiment with it.

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) 
   in your favorite browser.
